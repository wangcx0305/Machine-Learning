The code is written in the iPython console in Spyder with environment python 3.5. After we 
import the data, there are three parts of the code corresponding to part1, part2 and part3 in homework separately. For part1, there will export two prediction files for prediction for binomial model and multinomial model respectively, with H for Hillary and T for Trump. For part 2 and part 3, we only use the code to evaluate the test accuracy without exporting the prediction file because there are many cases. For part2 and part3, there are plots and results generating in the iPython console.
